SIMD. A computer which executes the same instructions on multiple pieces of data simultaneously. These are useful with algorithms which can be naturally parallelized, such as vector or matrix computations, image processing and the finite element method. Examples of devices with SIMD architecture are an array processor and a graphics processing unit (GPU).

Each processing unit (PU) is shown for a uni-core or multi-core compute:
